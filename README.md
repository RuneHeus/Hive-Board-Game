# Hive-Board-Game
Hive board game implemented in Scala with object-oriented design. Features a flexible grid-based board, multiple insect types (queen, beetles, grasshoppers) with distinct movement rules, and power-ups that modify gameplay. Players place and move insects to surround the opponent's queen. Modular design separates game logic and GUI.
